# Korean Hand-Torn Noodles (Sujebi)

## Ingredients
- 1⅔ cups (208 g or more) all-purpose flour  
- 1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt  
- 2 tsp. vegetable oil  

## Instructions
1. Mix flour, salt, and oil in a large bowl.
2. Gradually drizzle in scant ½ cup (104 g) water, mixing with your hand like a claw until dough comes together and forms a ball.
3. The dough will be shaggy and sticky, but don’t worry: it will get smoother when you knead it.
4. If dough feels too dry, add more water 1 Tbsp. at a time; if it feels too wet, add more flour 1 Tbsp. at a time.
5. Knead dough until it pulls away from the sides of the bowl and is taut with a smooth skin, 8–10 minutes.
6. Wrap dough in plastic or place in a resealable plastic bag and close.
7. Let rest at room temperature at least 15 minutes before using.

> **Do Ahead**: Dough can be made 12 hours ahead. Chill. Bring to room temperature before using.

**Makes 4 servings**

## Why Rest Matters

Resting wheat dough allows its gluten network to form, then relax, resulting in a flexible, bouncy texture that’s easy to shape.  
So how do you know when your dough is well-rested? The Goldilocks window is between 15 to 30 minutes, which is enough time for everything to settle before sour or fermented flavors start to develop.  
Forgot to set a timer? When your dough is just kneaded, it can be bumpy and lumpy. After resting, it’ll shape-shift into a smooth, elastic lentil ready to rip.
