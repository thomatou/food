# Crème Patissière
Recipe by Joël Boulay

## Ingredients
1. 500 mL whole milk
2. Pinch of salt
3. 1 vanilla bean 
4. 6 egg yolks
5. 80 g sugar
6. 40 g sifted flour 

## Instructions

Place ingredients 1 -> 2 in a small saucepan. Split the vanilla bean lengthwise, and scrape the seeds out of the pod; add both the seeds and the emptied pod into the milk mixture. Bring the whole mixture to a simmer (but watch that it doesn't boil over). 

In the meantime, whisk ingredients 4 and 5 in a mixing bowl, until the mixture whitens, and then add in ingredient 6, and keep whisking until the mixture is homogeneous. Once the milk has reached a simmer, add it to the egg yolk mixture while whisking continuously. Once a homogeneous mixture is obtained, put it back on the stove on low heat and never stop whisking to ensure that the mixture doesn't stick to the bottom. The mixture will eventually start bubbling; keep whisking for one minute after the first bubble is observed. 

Transfer the crème to a cold container, and let it cool down. Once cool, cover and keep in the fridge until needed.
