## Instructions

1. Sift the flour, baking powder, and ground almonds together.
2. Melt the butter and honey together in a pan, then take off the heat and set aside to cool until tepid. Add the lemon zest to this mix.
3. Use either a food mixer or an electric whisk to beat the eggs and both sugars together until voluminous and glossy.
4. Fold in the cooled butter and honey mixture, then finally fold in the sifted dry ingredients.
5. Put the mixture into the fridge to rest for 24 hours.
6. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C, then liberally butter and lightly flour your moulds.
7. Remove the mixture from the fridge and beat with a spoon, then spoon into the prepared moulds, just to three-quarters full.
8. Bake in batches for 8-10 minutes until golden and risen to just over the side of each mould.
9. Turn out onto racks to cool. Dust lightly with icing sugar before serving.
