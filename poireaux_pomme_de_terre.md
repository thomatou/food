* 350 g potatoes, peeled (or not)
* 200 g leeks, well cleaned
* 100 g butter
* 100 g creme fraiche
* 1 L water
* 15 g salt

Chop the leeks finely, and cook them in butter on low-medium heat, until they are soft but haven't taken on any colour.

Add the chopped potatoes to the pot, along with the salt. Continue cooking for a minute or so, then add the water. 

Increase the heat to high, and when the water reaches a boil, set a timer for 15 min. After that time, turn down the heat to medium-low, whisk in the cream, add some ground pepper and serve.
