Melt 180 g of salted butter and 180 g of dark chocolate in a pan. 

Whilst that's melting, whisk 180 g of sugar + 3 egg yolks until the mixture turns white.

Add the melted chocolate/butter mixture to that while continuously whisking.

Wait for the whole thing to cool down a bit, then add the 3 egg whites, followed by 50 g of flour. 

Cook for 18 min at 180 C for it to be gooey in the middle.
