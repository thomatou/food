# Crème Anglaise
Recipe by Claire Berger Vachon
## Ingredients
1. 1 L whole milk
2. Pinch of salt
3. 6 egg yolks
4. 100 g sugar
5. 1 vanilla bean

## Instructions

Place ingredients 1 -> 2 in a small saucepan. Split the vanilla pod lengthwise, and scrape the seeds out of the pod; add both the seeds and the emptied pod into the milk. Bring the mixture to a simmer (but watch that it doesn't boil over). 

In the meantime, whisk ingredients 3 -> 4 in a mixing bowl, until the mixture whitens. As soon as the milk has reached a simmer, add it to the egg yolk mixture while whisking continuously. Once a homogeneous mixture is obtained, put it back on the stove on low heat and never stop whisking to ensure that the mixture doesn't burn. The cream will thicken, and is ready when it is thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon.

Once cool, place the covered crème anglaise in the fridge; the vanilla flavour will intensify if left in the fridge overnight.
