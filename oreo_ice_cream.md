# Oreo ice cream

Adapted from Sweet Loâ€™s Cookies N Cream Recipe 



* 1 1/2 cup heavy cream 
* 1 1/2 cup whole milk 
* 1/2 cup non fat dry milk powder 
* 3/4 cup white sugar 
* Scant 1/4 tsp salt 
* 3 egg yolks 
* Splash of good quality vanilla extract 
* 12-15 Oreos* (more or less), roughly chopped

1. Whisk the cream, whole milk, non-fat milk powder, sugar, and salt in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Beat the egg yolks in a medium bowl. Slowly whisk 1 cup of the hot cream mixture into the beaten yolks, then pour back into the saucepan, whisking, and return to medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens, coats the spoon and reaches 180 degrees F on a thermometer, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl or measuring cup; discard the solids. Stir often until the mixture cools to room temperature. Add a splash of vanilla extract and stir. Lightly press plastic wrap directly against the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming. Chill until cold, about 4-6 hours. 

2.  Churn the cold custard in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's directions. Meanwhile, roughly chop your Oreo cookies.

3. Once the sweet cream is done churning, scoop it into a medium bowl, add the Oreos and stir them in. Quickly put it in a quart container and let harden in freezer for at least 3 hours. 

*Pro-tip: If you want an even more OREO-Y ice cream, take 5 additional Oreos, scrape and eat the filling, then steep the cookie portion with the dairy once the dry ingredients have dissolved. Remove from heat and let sit for 20 minutes. Remove the cookies and continue the recipe as directed.
