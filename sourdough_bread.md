Maintain sourdough starter at 100% hydration, with a feeding every 12 hours (40 g white all-purpose flour, 40 g water at temp 85-90 F, 10 g levain). 

When the levain is ready, mix 25 g levain with 100 white flour, 25 g whole wheat flour and 100 g water at temp 85-90 F. Leave the levain to double volume for ~ 10h at room temperature.

After that time, autolyse 302 g white flour, 138 g whole wheat flour in 342 g water at temp 90-95 F for 30 min. After that time, add 11 g of salt and 108 g of levain to your autolysed mixture. Fold 3 to 4 times, and let the bulk fermentation happen overnight (12â€“15 hours) until the dough has nearly tripled in size.



Addition of overnight oats: 
Prepare levain as usual. 
At the same time, mix 100 g rolled oats with 200 g water. 
880 g WWF
200 g oats
400 g of water added to the oats
518 g water
206 g levain


Next time, only mix equal weight oats with equal weight water so no need to fiddle with hydration calculation
