# Ice cream base
Recipe adapted from [David Lebovitz's recipe](https://www.davidlebovitz.com/vanilla-ice-cream/)

## Ingredients
1. 250 mL whole milk
2. Pinch of salt
3. 500 mL heavy cream
4. 5 egg yolks
5. 150 g sugar
6. 1 vanilla bean

## Instructions

Place ingredients 1 -> 3 in a small saucepan, along with 100 g of the sugar. Split the vanilla bean lengthwise, and scrape the seeds out of the pod; add both the seeds and the emptied pod into the milk/cream mixture. Bring the whole mixture to a simmer (but watch that it doesn't boil over). Remove from the heat, cover it, and let it infuse at room temperature for an hour. 

In the meantime, whisk the egg yolks and the remaining 50 g sugar in a mixing bowl, until the mixture whitens. Rewarm the milk/cream mixture, and once it reaches a simmer, add it to the egg yolk mixture while whisking continuously. Once a homogeneous mixture is obtained, put it back on the stove on low heat and never stop whisking to ensure that the mixture doesn't burn and stick to the bottom. The cream will thicken, and is ready when it has reached a temperature of 77 °C (170 °F). 

Let the custard cool down, cover it, and chill overnight. The next day, remove the vanilla pod from the cream, and freeze in the ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.

## Variations

To make coconut ice cream: add two generous tablespoons of coconut butter and 40 g of unsweetened, shredded coconut to the milk/cream mixture in lieu of the vanilla bean.
