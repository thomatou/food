# Clafoutis
Recipe by Claire

### Ingredients
For the base: 
1. 2 eggs
2. 200 mL whole milk
3. 1 glass of flour
4. 2 glasses of sugar
5. 1 glass of crème fraîche (can use sour cream instead)
6. Fruit: any of the following: Apricots, Pears, Cherries.

For the topping: 
7. 40 g brown sugar
8. 80 g butter
9. 1 egg

### Instructions
Preheat oven at 180 °C. Next, cut the fruits in halves, and arrange them so that they cover the base of a heavy dish (cast iron or porcelain). Next, prepare the base: Whisk ingredients 1 and 2, and once well beaten, incorporate ingredients 3 -> 5 to the mix. Pour this mixture on top of the fruit and bake for 20 min.
In the meantime, prepare the topping. Combine ingredients 7 and 8 in a small saucepan, and heat until the mixture starts browning. Take off the stove, and once cool, pour over the base, making sure to coat the partly baked batter/fruit mixture evenly. 
Put back in the oven for another 20 min, until the top has an amber colour.  
Give the clafoutis a couple of hours to cool before digging in; it's usually better the next day.
